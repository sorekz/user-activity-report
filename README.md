# user-activity-report
Create a User Activity Report for your Github organization. The action uses the Github GraphQL API and depending on the size of your organization will fetch a lot of data.

If you get an error because you reach the hourly rate limit of 5000 points you can either reduce the `since-days` or play with the other inputs. Comments cost a lot of points so you might want to disable them if not needed.

The action only fetches nested information on objects that have updates since `since-days`. So the total rate limit cost varies depending on the created/updated objects in the time window. It is printed at the end of the action and can be seen in the workflow logs.

üí° By default only the commits on the default branch are analyzed because usually the activity on other branches ends up in pull requests. You can set `analyze-commits-on-all-branches` to `true` to count commits on all branches.


## Usage:
```yaml
name: 'User Activity Report'
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  
jobs:
  'create-report':
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: sorekz/user-activity-report@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          organization: 'your-org'
```


## Example report
You can see the report in the action run summary

| User | Org member | Active | Commits | Created Issues | Issue Comments | Created PRs | Merged PRs | PR Comments | Created Discussions | Discussion Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| daniel | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚ùå | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| sorekz | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è | 8 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| dependabot | ‚ùå | ‚úîÔ∏è | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Inputs
### token
**Required** Github access token for the organization. Required permissions are `repo`, `read:org`

### organization
**Required** The organization to create the report for

### since-days
**Required** The number of days in the past to search for activity for. One day is relative to the start time and equal to 24 hours.\
default: `90`

### analyze-commits
Enable to analyze commits\
default: `true`

### analyze-commits-on-all-branches
Enable to analyze commits on all branches. By default only commits on the default branches are analyzed. Ignored if `analyze-commits` is `false`\
default: `false`

### analyze-issues
Enable to analyze issues\
default: `true`

### analyze-issue-comments
Enable to analyze issue comments\
default: `true`

### analyze-pull-requests
Enable to analyze pull requests\
default: `true`

### analyze-pull-request-comments
Enable to analyze pull requests comments\
default: `true`

### analyze-discussions
Enable to analyze discussions\
default: `true`

### analyze-discussion-comments
Enable to analyze discussions comments\
default: `true`

### create-json
Save the report as json file to this path

### create-csv
Save the report as csv file to this path

### create-summary
Write the report as step summary to the github action\
default: `true`

## Need to know
- Commits are only counted once. If you have `analyze-commits-on-all-branches` enabled then a commit that is part of multiple branches is only counted once. If you use merge commits a new commit with a new git ref is created and counted.
- Commits that have been authored but not committed before `since-days` are not counted. The commit date is relevant.
- A merged pull request is counted both in *Created PRs* and *Merged PRs* if it was created and merged within `since-days`



## Rate limit cost
The cost is nested so you can multiply each indention and sum it up. It is approximately:
- 1 per 100 organization members
- 1 per 100 repositories
  - 1 per 100 branches in each repository
    - 1 per 100 commits since `since-days` in each branch
  - 1 per 100 issues created/updated `since-days` in each repository
    - 1 per 100 issue comments in each issue
  - 1 per 100 pull requests in each repository
    - 1 per 100 pull request comments in each pull request
  - 1 per 100 discussions in each repository
    - 1 per 100 discussion comments in each pull request

Because the pull requests and discussions can not be queried based on a timestamp the action always fetches all but filters comments only for the objects that have updates (including added comments) since `since-days`.
